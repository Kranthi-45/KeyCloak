*KeyClock Installation & setup: 
 2 ways:
	1) Traditional by downloading zip file from the official site
	2) By Pulling Docker Image

 1) Traditional way:
 -----------------
	visit -> https://www.keycloak.org/
	Site -> Download ->  Server -> KeyClock(Distribution powered by Quarkus) -> Download It
                 for older versions go to Download -> scroll down click on Previous Release/Versions(19.0.1 currently using) -> then download it
                   
	Extract Zip -> open cmd at bin location (D:\KeyClock\keycloak-21.1.2\keycloak-21.1.2\bin)
	#command (to start/ local server from bin loader)
        code .
	cd bin
	./kc.bat start-dev

	Open http://localhost:8080/ in the browser & give a username, pass & sign in
	-Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
	-set username and password for admin (ex: admin/admin)

         or

 2) Pulling Docker Image:
 ----------------------
	-Install Docker
	#commands
	docker version
	docker pull jboss/keycloak             (pull the KeyCloak image from Docker Hub )
	docker run -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e DB_VENDOR=H2 jboss/keycloak

	-Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
	-login with above creds
      info:
      ----
	-the port you need to expose is 8080,
	-Keycloak doesn’t have an initial admin account by default; to be able to log in, you need to provide KEYCLOAK_USER and KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD environment variables,
	you need to specify a database for Keycloak to use, with the easiest option being an embedded H2 instance; 
	if you’d like to provide another (PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB are supported out-of-the-box), you can follow the instructions in the image reference.

*Configuring KeyCloak after up:
	-Admintrative console -> login(admin -created creds) ->
	*Creating users:
		add users ->Users -> Add user -> creatusers(ex: testuser/testuser)
		select a created user from list of users -> credentials -> setpassword
	*Creating clients:
		clients -> create client -> enter details -> next,next & save (ex: client1, client2 ..etc)
	
  *Adding Clients to Users:( optional ---> based on custom_attribute : allowedClients) --------------- optional used in realtime projects
	 -login as admin: admin/admin
		Users -> select specific user(ex: testuser) -> Attributes -> key(allowedClients),value(client1,client2) -> save
	 -relogin/refresh the testuser keycloack
		Under application -> app -> u can see two above added clients
	
	 -open keycloak site in the incognito tab & login as another testuser we created
		top right click on username -> manage account -> Applications (so can see what all apps/clients have accces to this user here)
		
*To change the default theme:(instead of kecloak theme)				------------------------ optional used in realtime projects
	-Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
	-login as admin -> Realm settings -> themes -> login,account,..etc(need to choose theme from dropdown)
		*To see our custom theme in the dropdown, First in our local keycloak code/path under the themes folder need to add/clone
	  	 our custom theme folder in keycloak downloaded files unde themes folder (path after adding ex: themes/user-management-keycloak-theme-lib)
		*save it & refresh it in keycloak server now you can see the custom theme in the admin themes dropdown.
